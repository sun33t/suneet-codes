It's silly but it's so much fun! What every developer needs is a bit of levity to break up the day! Enter the git push confetti cannon! Marvel in wonder as your mac (sorry linux and windows users) rewards your efforts with a virtual pat on the back in the form of confetti and cheers! You're awesome!!!

## What are we building?

A git hook to invoke a raycast extension to fire confetti and applause upon a successful commit.

## Is there a video I can watch or a repo I can clone?

No video just yet, but [here's a link]() to a demo repo that can be cloned.

## What are the steps?

In the immortal words of mario... "Letsa go!"

### Step 1 - Install raycast

What do you mean you don't have Raycast installed already? It's amazing, let's do that by downloading it [here](https://www.raycast.com/) or if you use homebrew by issuing `brew install raycast --cask` from the terminal.

### Step 2 - Install 1-Click Confetti

This is an extension for Raycast. You can either install it from within Raycast itself by searching for it on the store - instructions on how to do that [here](https://manual.raycast.com/store). You can also visit the [extension's page](https://www.raycast.com/peduarte/1-click-confetti) directly and install it from there by clicking the `install extension button`.

### Step 3 - Create a Deep-Link

[Deep-links](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) are a macos feature that allow developers of macos apps to provide users with a custom url to target a feature of their application. They're excellent and the wonderful team at Raycast have built wonderful support for them. Follow the instructions [here](https://manual.raycast.com/deeplinks) to generate a deep link that targets the 1-click confetti `Confetti Command` option (not the `Confetti in Menu Bar option`) and ensure to follow the process to select `Always open command`.

### Step 4 - Add the Deep-Link into the Git Hook

The quickest way to get this up and running is to clone down the linked example repo. It's a node project so that'll need to be installed on your system first. Follow the instructions in the `Readme.md` to install dependencies and then double check that the deep link in the `.husky/post-commit` hook matches the one that you created. If not, replace it.

If you'd rather learn how to build the repo yourself, you can find articles on this site which go through the process of setting up git hooks with [node](/linting-formatting-setup), [deno](linting-formatting-setup-deno) and [bun](linting-formatting-setup-bun) projects.

### Step 5 - Launch the Cannon

Make a change in the repo and `git commit`! Did you ever think git could be so much fun? I'm a dork! I know but I don't care. Life's too short and this makes me smile! Hopefully it made you smile a little bit too!
