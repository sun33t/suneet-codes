## What are we making?

We're going to setup a basic Node.js project with a linting and formatting automation that will use `git hooks` to act upon staged files when we `git commit`. We won't be installing any frameworks here as the purpose of this project is to illustrate the ease at which linting and formatting automations can be setup. As projects become more complex in their architecture, the need to extend the linting and formatting configurations may arise and this can be accomplished by ammending configuration rules or by importing preset configurations and plugins.

As an added extra, we can also use the same approach of git lifecycle automations to standardise commit messages with `conventional-commit` syntax! There'll be a future article diving deeper into the concept of conventional commits and the potential it may have to add value to projects, but for now, we'll go through an optional example of how to set it up.

## Why?

I'm a bit of a weirdo. I like to ensure that before my work is committed to git locally, staged files comply with my project's linting and formatting rules, there are no TypeScript compilation errors and commit messages are formatted in a consistent manner. I stop short of adding a test run locally because I'm just a weirdo, not a masochist.

We could rely upon IDE extensions to automatically format and lint as we progress through our work, but having a setup like this both acts as a fail-safe to ensure only compliant code is being committed, and makes configuration portable within the repo. Collaborators can automatically inherit the setup when the repo is cloned.

Together with IDE extensions, this workflow makes for a robust toolchain.

## What are we using?

The key libraries are:

- [**typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Type-safe way of writing JavaScript
- [**eslint**](https://eslint.org/): For highlighting potential problems which may lead to errors within the runtime environment.
- [**prettier**](https://prettier.io/): For enforcing a common style for our source code to aid readability.
- [**husky**](https://github.com/typicode/husky): For accessing git hooks.
- [**lint-staged**](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): For running commands against staged files.
- [**gitmoji-cli**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji): An interactive terminal for formatting commits with emojis and [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax.

## I don't have time to read! Is there a video I can watch or a repo I can clone?

I hear you, life is busy... I haven't made a video yet but [here's a link](https://github.com/sun33t/0001-linting-formatting-setup) to a demo repo that you can clone!

## What are the steps?

I love the enthusiasm! Let's get started!

### 1. Initialise the project

```shell terminal
npm init -y && git init
```

In your terminal, create a new directory for your project and `cd` into it. Use the `npm init -y && git init` command to initialise a new node project with git in the current directory.

### Step 2 - Install Dependencies

Node doesn't ship with any linting or formatting libraries so we'll be installing the following as development dependencies:

```shell terminal
npm install -D husky lint-staged prettier typescript @types/node
```

When you issue the above you may find your IDE indicated that a few hundred files have changed. Panic not! We just need to create a `.gitignore` file and add our `node_modules` directory to it. This can be done with the following command.

```shell terminal
echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
```

A more robust way of creating a .gitignore for your project is to use the open source tool provided by [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/) which we can also use on the command line with the [`add-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/add-gitignore) package as follows:

```shell terminal
npx add-gitignore node macos
```

We're using the `node` template here because we're creating a node project. We're also using the `macos` template here becuase this is the system being developed on. can be modified based upon the system being developed on. Linux and windows templatese are also available.

### 3. Initialise TypeScript

There's a few ways that we can configure `TypeScript` within our project. The first is to initialise it using the `tsc` cli by issuing `npx tsc --init`.

This will generate a default `tsconfig.json` configuration file, with some options chosen. See [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) for more information about these options.

Another way is to make use of [preset base configurations](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/) which we can extend from. This is a great choice for those who aren't familiar with all of TypeScript's compiler options, and require some sensible defaults to start with.

We're going to use this second option and set up our TypeScript configuration to extend from the `node-lts` base configuration.

<CodeWithTabs>
```shell !!tabs 1. download base tsconfig
npm install -D @tsconfig/node-lts
```

```json !!tabs 2. tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/node-lts/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

</CodeWithTabs>

We can start by installing the base configuration as a development dependency, and then create a `tsconfig.json` file with the above configuration.

Our tsconfig.json file brings in the base configuration and instructs typescript to only include files located within the `src` directory for type-checking and compilation to JavaScript. Additionally, it sets the directory to output the compiled `JavaScript` to a `./dist/` directory.

### 4. Configure Prettier

With prettier installed, all we need to do is to add a configuration file at project root. We're going to use a `prettier.config.mjs` file (there are a few types of configuration files that prettier [offers](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration)) as follows:

```javascript ./prettier.config.mjs
/**
 * @see https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html
 * @type {import("prettier").Config}
 */

const config = {
  printWidth: 80,
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: false,
  trailingComma: "es5",
  bracketSpacing: true,
  proseWrap: "preserve",
};

export default config;
```

This config can be adjusted to suit formatting preferences, these are just some basic choices to get started with.

### 5. Configure Lint-Staged

Similar to prettier, once installed we just need to add a configuration file which again can be accomplished in a [variety of ways](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) but we're going to use a `lint-staged.config.mjs` file:

```javascript ./lint-staged.config.mjs
import path from "node:path";

const config = {
  "*.{cjs,mjs,js,ts,jsx,tsx}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `eslint --fix ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
  "*.{css,md,mdx,json}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
};
export default config;
```

The above contains two different linting/formatting flows. Firstly for JS and TS filetypes, it uses `eslint` to fix any linting errors and then invokes `prettier` to format those files. The second configuration is for CSS, Markdown and JSON files and it simply invokes `prettier` to format those files.

### 6. Configure Husky

Finally, let's setup husky which will bring all our work together.

<CodeWithTabs>
```shell !!tabs 1. initialise husky
npx husky init
```

```shell !!tabs 2. pre-commit.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

npx tsc --noEmit
npx lint-staged
```

</CodeWithTabs>

Initialise husky with `npx husky init`. This will bootstrap a `.husky` directory and add a `prepare` script to the project (see the husky docs for a full explanation). Within the `.husky` directory you'll see a `pre-commit` hook has already been created for you. We're going to replace its contents with that of the tab above.

The git life-cycle has many stages within it and we can execute scripts during those stages by using [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks). The [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) hook is invoked prior the staged files being merged into the current branch. We're adding into the pre-commit hook, the ability to typecheck our repo and run our lint-staged configuration against those currently staged files. The hook will fail if an error is encountered by either command, thereby interrupting the git process, prompting us to address the errors that were flagged in the terminal.

### 7. Configure eslint

```shell terminal
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

The final step to take is to install and configure eslint, which we can do with the `npm init @eslint/config@latest` command, choosing the following cli options:

```shell terminal
✔ How would you like to use ESLint? · problems
✔ What type of modules does your project use? · esm
✔ Which framework does your project use? · none
✔ Does your project use TypeScript? · typescript
✔ Where does your code run? · node
The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:

eslint, globals, @eslint/js, typescript-eslint
✔ Would you like to install them now? · No / Yes
✔ Which package manager do you want to use? · npm
```

When the cli completes, we should now have eslint and its dependencies installed as well as new `eslint.config.mjs` file with the selected configuration applied.

That's it, all the setup and configuration is complete. Congrats!

## Now What?

Well, all we need to do now is to develop as we normally would! The fruit of our labour should be seen within the terminal when we issue `git commit`! Our staged files will be linted and formatted prior to inputting our commit message and all will be well with the world and we'll be rewarded with coffee and chocolate for the rest of our glorious days!

Why not start by adding the following method into the project:

```typescript src/index.ts
export const main = () => {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};

main();
```

With this we can test whether compilation to javascript works correctly with `npx tsc` and we can also commit the method to test the code quality configuration.

## Bypassing Git Hooks...

Git hooks are really powerful and really useful and this setup works super well in almost all instances. However, there may come a time where it might be necessary to perform the unspeakable task of committing work that doesn't pass static analysis or typechecking. In those (reckless but necessary) circumstances, the hook can be bypassed by adding the `--no-verify` flag to the `git commit` command. E.g.

```shell
git commit -m "your commit messsge here" --no-verify"
```

With great power, comes great yada yada yada. You get it.

## Added Extra!

We touched on conventional commits above in the introduction, but as a reminder, it's a concept for standardising commit messages, which in turn makes it easier to understand the unit of work which was added into the branch with each commit. We're going to use the `prepare-commit-msg` git hook to invoke the `gitmoji` cli which will take over the default terminal experience for adding a commit message, and replave it with an interactive terminal that will guide us through writing a commit message which complies with conventional-commit syntax. But wait, that's not all... This setup will also add emojis to our commit messages, leading to our project earning infinite stars on github, infinite VC investment and more money than even Erlich Bachmann would know what to do with...

<CodeWithTabs>
```shell !!tabs 1. install gitmoji-cli
npm install -D gitmoji-cli
```

```json !!tabs 2. package.json
  "gitmoji": {
    "autoAdd": false,
    "emojiFormat": "emoji",
    "scopePrompt": false,
    "messagePrompt": true,
    "capitalizeTitle": true,
    "gitmojisUrl": "https://gitmoji.dev/api/gitmojis"
  }
```

```shell !!tabs 3. prepare-commit-msg.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

if npx -v >&/dev/null
then
  exec < /dev/tty
  npx -c "gitmoji --hook $1 $2"
else
  exec < /dev/tty
  gitmoji --hook $1 $2
fi
```

</CodeWithTabs>

Let's start with installing gitmoji-cli as a project devDependency. When installed, lets add some configuration to specify how we would like the interactive terminal to behave once it's invoked by adding teh above into the root of our package.json.

Finally lets add a [prepare-commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook with the details above into our .husky directory.

Now when you run `git commit` once typchecking, linting and formatting has been completed, we'll be provided an interactive terminal to format our commit message!

If we want to modify the gitmoji-cli configuration, we can checkout the docs [here](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#config). It's highly recommended to do a bit of background reading into conventional-commit syntax. We're using gitmoji in this example as emojis are objectively awesome... fact. They work great for personal projects, but if team projects require a less delightful way to standardize commit messages, [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is a great alternative.

## Super Bonus Extra!

For the vscode users reading this, here's some IDE-specific configuration to complement our code quality workflow. Create a `.vscode` directory at project root and create each of the following within:

<CodeWithTabs>

```json !!tabs 1. extensions.json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "mylesmurphy.prettify-ts",
    "orta.vscode-twoslash-queries",
    "yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
  ]
}
```

```json !!tabs 2. settings.json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.requireConfig": true,
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
}
```

</CodeWithTabs>

- **Recommended extensions** for projects using eslint, prettier and typescript
- **project-scoped settings** for invoking the prettier and eslint extensions to do their thing as files are saved.
