## What are we making?

We're going to bootstrap a Next.js project and install an automated workflow which runs during the git life-cycle to lint and format staged files. It will also provide us with an interactive terminal to standardize commit messages using conventional-commit syntax. All we need to do to invoke this workflow is to `git commit`.

## Why?

I'm a bit of a weirdo. I like to ensure that before my work is committed to git locally, staged files comply with my project's linting and formatting rules, there are no TypeScript compilation errors and that the commit messages are formatted with conventional-commit syntax. I stop short of adding a test run locally because I'm just a weirdo, not a masochist.

We could rely upon IDE extensions to automatically format and lint as we progress through our work, but having a setup like this both acts as a fail-safe to ensure only compliant code is being committed, and makes configuration portable within the repo. Collaborators can automatically inherit the setup when the repo is cloned.

Together with IDE extensions, this workflow makes for a robust toolchain.

## What are we using?

We're going to be using the following:

- **[Next.js](https://Next.js.org/docs)**: A react meta-framework for building web applications.
- **[eslint](https://eslint.org/)**: A configurable linter that attempts to highlight potential problems that may lead to errors within the runtime environment.
- **[prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: A formatter which allows us to enforce a specific style for our source code.
- **[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)**: A prettier plugin that provides some added value to using Tailwind CSS (like auto-sorting classes).
- **[@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)**: A prettier plugin that provides a way to sort imports within a file in a specifed order. Inspired by [CJ Reynold's](https://bsky.app/profile/w3cj.com) walkthrough of his [next-start](https://github.com/w3cj/next-start) project. It's a fab video which can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/dLRKV-bajS4?si=9iwAucEekONazrrf)!
- **[husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)**: A tool that allows us add git lifecycle hooks to our repo. We could make use of the hooks provided by the `.git` directory within the project folder but using husky allows us to have our hooks committed so that they are portable with the project.
- **[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)**: A library that allows us to run commands against staged files. It allows us to differentiate between file types, and run a different set of commands against each.
- **[gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji)**: An interactive terminal that allows us to format git messages in accordance with [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax, but with emojis. Because emojis are great ok.

## I don't have time to read! Is there a video I can watch or a repo I can clone?

I hear you, life is busy... I haven't made a video yet but [here's a link](https://github.com/sun33t/0001-linting-formatting-setup) to a demo repo that you can clone!

## What are the steps?

I love the enthusiasm! Let's get started!

### 1. Bootstrap Project with Next.js

Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to perform the initial setup. The cli will step you through some options. We'll be choosing the configuration in the tab below:

<CodeWithTabs>
```shell !!tabs 1. install
npx create-next-app@latest linting-formatting-setup
```

```shell !!tabs 2. configuration
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … Yes
✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … No
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? … No
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … No
```

</CodeWithTabs>

This bootstrap already contains an `eslint` configuration which works great for our purposes so we're not going to implement any changes to that.

### 2. Install Dependencies

`cd` into our project and install the remaining libraries that we'll need:

```shell terminal
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss husky lint-staged gitmoji-cli @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports
```

### 3. Configure Prettier

With prettier and our included plugins installed, all we need to do is to add a configuration file at project root. We're going to use a `prettier.config.mjs` file (there are a few types of configuration files that prettier [offers](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration)) as follows:

```javascript ./prettier.config.mjs
/**
 * @see https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html
 * @type {import("prettier").Config}
 */

const config = {
  printWidth: 80,
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: false,
  trailingComma: "es5",
  bracketSpacing: true,
  proseWrap: "preserve",
  plugins: [
    "@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss",
  ],
  importOrder: ["^[./]", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>", "^@/(.*)$"],
  importOrderSeparation: true,
  importOrderSortSpecifiers: true,
};

export default config;
```

This config can be adjusted to suit formatting preferences but the important thing to be aware of is that the plugins array must be populated correctly with our plugin names. The last three properties in the config (`importOrder`, `importOrderSeparation` and `importOrderSortSpecifiers`) are provided by `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`. Please read [their docs](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports) for more information on how to configure them.

### 4. Configure Lint-Staged

Similar to prettier, once installed we just need to add a configuration file which again can be accomplished in a [variety of ways](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) but we're going to use a `lint-staged.config.mjs` file:

```javascript ./lint-staged.config.mjs
import path from "node:path";

const config = {
  "*.{cjs,mjs,js,ts,jsx,tsx}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `next lint --fix --file ${stagedFiles
      .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))
      .join(" --file ")}`,
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
  "*.{css,md,mdx,json}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
};
export default config;
```

The above contains two different linting flows. Firstly for JS and TS filetypes, it uses `next lint` (which runs eslint under the hood) to fix any linting errors and then invokes `prettier` to format those files. The second configuration is for CSS, Markdown and JSON files and it simply invokes `prettier` to format those files.

### 5. Configure Gitmoji

We're installing gitmoji as a project dependency rather than a global node dependency. Therefore, lets add some configuration to specify how we would like the interactive terminal to behave once it's invoked. Add the following property to the root of your `package.json`:

```json ./package.json
  "gitmoji": {
    "autoAdd": false,
    "emojiFormat": "emoji",
    "scopePrompt": false,
    "messagePrompt": true,
    "capitalizeTitle": true,
    "gitmojisUrl": "https://gitmoji.dev/api/gitmojis"
  }
```

If we want to modify this configuration ,we can checkout the docs [here](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#config). It's highly recommended to do a bit of background reading into how conventional-commit syntax can be used to help standardise commit messages! We're using gitmoji in this example as emojis are objectively awesome... fact. They work great for personal projects but if team projects require a less delighful way to standardize commit messages, [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is a great alternative.

### 6. Configure Husky

Finally, let's setup husky which will bring all our work together.

<CodeWithTabs>
```shell !!tabs 1. initialise husky
npx husky init
```

```shell !!tabs 2. pre-commit.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

npx tsc --noEmit
npx lint-staged
```

```shell !!tabs 3. prepare-commit-msg.sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

if npx -v >&/dev/null
then
  exec < /dev/tty
  npx -c "gitmoji --hook $1 $2"
else
  exec < /dev/tty
  gitmoji --hook $1 $2
fi
```

</CodeWithTabs>

Initialise husky with `npx husky init`. This will bootstrap a `.husky` directory and add a `prepare` script to the project (see the husky docs for a full explanation). Within the `.husky` directory you'll see a `pre-commit` hook has already been created for you. We're going to replace the contents in the tab above.

Next to this, within the `.husky` directory, we're also going to create a new `prepare-commit-msg` hook as outlined in the tab above.

The git life-cycle has many stages within it and we can execute scripts during those stages by using [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks). When the [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) hook runs, it will check for any typescript errors in the project and then it will invoke our lint-staged configuration. The hook will fail if an error is encountered by either command, thereby interrupting the git process.

The [prepare-commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook will be invoked immediatly before the point at which we would normally write our commit message. It will replace the default terminal input experience with an interactive terminal provided by gitmoji-cli.

That's it, all the setup amnd configuration is complete. Congrats!

## Now What?

Well, all we need to do now is to develop as we normally would! The fruit of our labour should be seen within the terminal when we issue `git commit`! Our staged files will be linted and formatted prior to inputting our commit message and instead of being provided with a terminal prompt to do that, we'll be delivered an interactive experience!

## Super Bonus Extra!

For the vscode users reading this, here's some IDE-specific configuration to complement our code quality workflow. Create a `.vscode` directory at project root and create each of the following within:

<CodeWithTabs>

```json !!tabs 1. extensions.json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss"
  ],
  "unwantedRecommendations": []
}
```

```json !!tabs 2. launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug client-side",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Next.js: debug full stack",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next",
      "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "action": "debugWithChrome",
        "killOnServerStop": true,
        "pattern": "- Local:.+(https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```json !!tabs 3. settings.json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.requireConfig": true,
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true,
  "files.associations": {
    "*.css": "tailwindcss"
  }
}
```

</CodeWithTabs>

- **Recommended extensions** for projects using eslint, prettier and tailwindcss
- A **debugging configuration** for Next.js projects, inspired by the [official docs](https://Next.js.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/debugging).
- **project-scoped settings** for invoking the prettier and eslint extensions to do their thing as files are saved.

Thanks for taking the time to read this article. I hope it helps and inspires you to learn and share your knowledge with others!
