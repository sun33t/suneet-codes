description: This is my personal setup for linting, formatting and commiting when working on NodeJS projects. It uses ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Lint-Staged and Gitmoji for ensuring that linted and formatted code is committed to git using, conventional-commit syntax, prior to being pushed to remote.

## What are we making?

We're going to bootstrap a NextJS project and install an automated workflow which runs during the git life-cycle to lint and format our work. It will also provide us with an interactive terminal to standardize our commit messages using conventional-commit syntax. All we need to do to invoke this workflow is to `git commit`.

## Why are we doing this?

I'm a bit of a weirdo. I like to ensure that before my work is committed to git locally, the staged files comply with my project's linting and formatting rules, that there are no TypeScript compilation errors and that the commit messages are formatted with conventional-commit syntax. I stop short of adding a test run locally because I'm just a weirdo, not a masachist.

We could rely upon IDE extensions to automatically format and lint as we progress through our work, but having a setup like this both acts as a fail-safe to ensure only compliant code is being committed, and makes configuration portable within the repo. Collaborators can automatically inherit the setup when the repo is cloned. Together with IDE extensions, this workflow makes for a robust toolchain.

## What are we using?

We're going to be using the following:

- **[nextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs)**: A react meta-framework for building web applications.
- **[eslint](https://eslint.org/)**: A configurable linter that attempts to highlight potential problems that may lead to errors within the runtime environment.
- **[prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: A formatter which allows us to enforce a specific style for our source code. Prettier has a plugin architecture allowing developers to extend formatting configurations.
- **[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)**: A prettier plugin that provides some added value to using Tailwind CSS (like auto-sorting classes).
- **[@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)**: A prettier plugin that provides a way to sort imports within a file in a specifed order. I picked up this little gem from watching [CJ Reynold's](https://bsky.app/profile/w3cj.com) walkthrough of his [next-start](https://github.com/w3cj/next-start) project. It's a fab watch and you can see that [here](https://youtu.be/dLRKV-bajS4?si=9iwAucEekONazrrf).
- **[husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)**: A tool that allows us to run commands during the `git` lifecycle. We could place scripts directly into the `.git` directory within the project folder but using husky allows us to have our scripts committed so they are portable with the project.
- **[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)**: A library that allows us to run commands against staged files. It allows us to differentiate between file types, and run a different set of commands against each.
- **[gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji)**: An interactive terminal that allows us to format git messages in accordance with [conventional-commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax, but with emojis. Because emojis are great ok.

## I don't have time to read! Is there a video I can watch or a repo I can clone?

I hear you, life is busy... I haven't made a video yet but here's a link to a demo repo that you can clone!

- [Demo Repo](https://github.com/sun33t/0001-linting-formatting-setup)

## What are the steps?

I love the enthusiasm! Let's get started!

### 1. Bootstrap Project with NextJS

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest linting-formatting-setup
```

Use `npx create-next-app@latest` to perform the initial setup. The cli will step you through some options. We'll be choosing the configuration below:

```bash terminal
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … Yes
✔ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … No
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? … No
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … No
```

This bootstrap already contains an `eslint` configuration which we don't need to modify for the purpose of this article.

### 2. Install Dependencies

`cd` into our project and install the remaining libraries that we'll need:

```bash terminal
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss husky lint-staged gitmoji-cli @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports
```

### 3. Configure Prettier

With prettier and our included plugins installed, all we need to do is to add a configuration file at project root. We're going to use a `prettier.config.mjs` file (there are a few types of configuration files that prettier [offers](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration)) as follows:

```javascript ./prettier.config.mjs
/**
 * @see https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html
 * @type {import("prettier").Config}
 */

const config = {
  printWidth: 80,
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: false,
  trailingComma: "es5",
  bracketSpacing: true,
  proseWrap: "preserve",
  plugins: [
    "@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss",
  ],
  importOrder: ["^[./]", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>", "^@/(.*)$"],
  importOrderSeparation: true,
  importOrderSortSpecifiers: true,
};

export default config;
```

This config can be adjusted to suit formatting preferences but the important thing to be aware of is that the plugins array must be populated correctly with our plugin names. The last three properties in the config (`importOrder`, `importOrderSeparation` and `importOrderSortSpecifiers`) are provided by `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`. Please read [their docs](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports) for more information on how to configure them.

### 4. Configure Lint-Staged

Similar to prettier, once installed we just need to add a configuration file which again can be accomplished in a [variety of ways](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) but we're going to use a `lint-staged.config.mjs` file:

```javascript ./lint-staged.config.mjs
import path from "node:path";

const config = {
  "*.{cjs,mjs,js,ts,jsx,tsx}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `next lint --fix --file ${stagedFiles
      .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))
      .join(" --file ")}`,
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
  "*.{css,md,mdx,json}": (stagedFiles) => [
    `prettier --write ${stagedFiles.join(" ")}`,
  ],
};
export default config;
```

The above contains two different linting flows. Firstly for JS and TS filetypes, it uses `next lint` (which runs eslint under the hood) to fix any linting errors and then invokes `prettier` to format those files. The second configuration is for CSS, Markdown and JSON files and it simply invokes `prettier` to format those files.

### 5. Configure Gitmoji

We're installing gitmoji as a project dependency rather than a global node dependency. Therefore, lets add some configuration to specify how we would like the interactive terminal to behave once it's invoked. Add the following property to the root of your `package.json`:

```json ./package.json
  "gitmoji": {
    "autoAdd": false,
    "emojiFormat": "emoji",
    "scopePrompt": false,
    "messagePrompt": true,
    "capitalizeTitle": true,
    "gitmojisUrl": "https://gitmoji.dev/api/gitmojis"
  }
```

If we want to modify this configuration ,we can checkout the docs [here](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#config). It's highly recommended to do a bit of background reading into how conventional-commit syntax can be used to help standardise commit messages! We're using gitmoji in this example as emojis are objectively awesome... fact. They work great for personal projects but if team projects require a less delighful way to standardize commit messages, [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is a great alternative.

### 6. Configure Husky

Finally, let's setup husky which will bring all our work together.

```bash
npx husky init
```

Initialise husky with `npx husky init`. This will bootstrap a `.husky` directory and add a `prepare` script to the project (see the husky docs for a full explanation). Within the `.husky` directory you'll see a `pre-commit` script has already been created for you. We're going to replace the contents of this with the following:

```bash .husky/pre-commit
#!/usr/bin/env sh

npx tsc --noEmit
npx lint-staged
```

Next to this, we're also going to create a new `prepare-commit-msg` script:

```bash .husky/prepare-commit-msg
#!/usr/bin/env sh

if npx -v >&/dev/null
then
  exec < /dev/tty
  npx -c "gitmoji --hook $1 $2"
else
  exec < /dev/tty
  gitmoji --hook $1 $2
fi
```

The git life-cycle has many stages within it and we can access those stages by using these scripts which can be reffered to as [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) using gits nomenclature. When the [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) hook runs, it will check for any typescript errors in the project and then it will invoke our lint-staged configuration. The hook will fail if an error is encountered by either command, thereby interrupting the git process.

The [prepare-commit-msg](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook will be invoked immediatly before the point at which we would normally write our commit message, and will replace the default terminal input with an interactive terminal served by gitmoji-cli.

## Now What?

Well once we've completed all the setup, all we need to do now is develop and `git commit`! As we commit our work, we should see the fruit of our labour within the terminal ! Our staged files will be linted and formatted prior to inputting our commit message and instead of being provided with a terminal prompt to do that, we'll be delivered an interactive experience!

## Conclusion

What have we learned today? We can use local tooling to help guard against introducing potential errors and bugs into our source code repository. Whilst an individual developer's IDE setup may use extensions to lint and format as they work, not everyone in the team may have the same workflow. Providing one that is baked into the project and is automated is a very powerful and frictionless way to add an extra guard, prior to pushing to remote. Also, emojis in commit messages are fab!

Whilst it's tempting to have a one-size-fits-all configuration for code quality, it's actually more beneficial that the configuration arrived at is tailored to the needs of the specific project, and the preferences of the team members involved where possible. Putting the extra effort into these considerations actually encourages you to understand the project architecture better!

Keeping an eye on the broad strokes of this setup (a linting/formatting config, a way to invoke commands on staged files, a way to automate those commands without interrupting the dev experience and a structure to adding commit messages to the branch) is much more important than restricting yourself to these particular tools and configurations. Being aware of the **why** empowers you to explore new tools, processes and patterns in future projects.
